# A Comparative Evaluation of Interactive Data Visualization Libraries for Beginners

This repository contains the supplemental code files for my paper — "A Comparative Evaluation of Interactive Data Visualization Libraries for Beginners" — that I submitted as my final project for Media, Arts, and Technology 237: Designing Expressive Technologies, which was a graduate-level class in human-computer interaction design methodologies and processes that I took at UC Santa Barbara as a second-year undergraduate. 

## Abstract
Interactive data visualization software offers dynamic and engaging methods to explore datasets, enabling users to communicate insights and findings to their audience more effectively than with static visualizations. In this analysis, I delved into five prominent interactive data visualization libraries — D3.js, Chart.js, Plotly Express, Bokeh, and ggplot2 with the ggiraph extension —and examined their beginner-friendliness by testing out their basic interactive bar chart capabilities and evaluating their features and aesthetics, the relevance and intuitiveness of documentation present, the prior programming concepts required to create the charts, and how well ChatGPT is able to help a beginner code with that library. Based on my analysis, I propose a framework for a new data visualization library that prioritizes intuitive design, comprehensive documentation, minimal programming prerequisites, and seamless integration with AI assistance tools like ChatGPT in order to empower new programmers to create compelling interactive visualizations with ease and facilitate better understanding and communication of complex data insights.
