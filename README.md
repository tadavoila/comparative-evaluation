# A Comparative Evaluation of Interactive Data Visualization Libraries for Beginners

This repository contains the supplemental code files for my paper — "A Comparative Evaluation of Interactive Data Visualization Libraries for Beginners" — that I submitted as my final project for Media, Arts, and Technology 237: Designing Expressive Technologies, which was a graduate-level class in human-computer interaction design methodologies and processes that I took at UC Santa Barbara as a second-year undergraduate. 

`ucsbcovid.csv` contains the dataset I used.
